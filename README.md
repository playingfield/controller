## Overview

This project automates the deployment of an Ansible Controller featuring a web-based interface through SemaphoreUI. Semaphore runs within a Docker container, while components like PostgreSQL and Nginx operate directly on the host system.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) installed on your local machine.
   - [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) installed on the host system.

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/bbaassssiiee/controller.git
   cd controller
   ```

3. **Set environment variables**:
   Define the database password by exporting the `DB_PASS` environment variable:
   ```bash
   export DB_PASS=your_database_password
   ```

4. **Run the playbook**:
   Execute the Ansible playbook to provision the environment:
   ```bash
   ansible-playbook provision.yml -i inventory/local
   ```

   **Note**: The `inventory/local` configuration is suitable for direct deployment on systems like Red Hat, AlmaLinux, or Rocky Linux. In this setup, Vagrant and VirtualBox are not required.

## Configuration

- **SSL Certificates**: By default, self-signed certificates are used. For production environments, it is recommended to implement certificates from a trusted certificate authority.

- **Database Password**: Ensure that the `DB_PASS` environment variable is set with a strong password before running the playbook.

## Usage

After successful installation, SemaphoreUI is accessible via your web browser at the address configured in your `/etc/hosts` file.
